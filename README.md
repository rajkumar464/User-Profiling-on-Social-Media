# User-Profiling-on-Social-Media

The aim of the project is to build a system that automatically predicts the age category, gender, and personality scores of Facebook users when given input of status updates, profile picture, and "likes" of the users. The program takes input from a source specified by the user and also outputs the results to a user-specified directory. 

The project is three-pronged with 3 team members each using a different source. The three sources used are :

1. Text
2. Image
3. Likes
